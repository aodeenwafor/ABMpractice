         <td>Children often use dolls to visualize social interactions and play out scenarios from real life, so it's a great way of understanding what your child thinks of different ethnicities and delivering subtle self-empowering messages. With over half of America's children now 'children of color,' we're proud to offer the largest selection of Brown Dolls, Ethnic dolls and other Multicultural  dolls for your children. From dolls for the children of the South Asian to Africans in diaspora, and every other culture we can think of, we're sure that somewhere in our collection you will find the perfect doll for your child!</td>
