            <p>Those aching muscles, the knee, the waist, oh I haven’t had a bowl movement in days, what was I saying again? I can’t remember”. These are some of the things we may experience as we age. The good news is we can control how we age (to some extent); it all needs a little effort. Genetics also plays a role in the outcome of your health as you age. Medical history and how one lived in their younger years may affect the quality of our life when much older.</p>

	        <dd>As you age having a healthy weight is very important. This can be achieved by making good food choices like cutting down on saturated fats in dairy foods and meats and eating slightly more vegetables and whole-grain.</dd>
	       
	        <dt style="color:brown;font-size: 20px">Vitamins are very important</dt>
            <dd>Fruit and vegetables contain lots of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Choose dark green or brightly coloured vegetables and fruit more often. Grab an apple for an afternoon snack instead of cupcake. Spice up your meals with these beautiful foods like adding berries or sliced bananas in your cereal, have vegetables with dinner.</dd>
