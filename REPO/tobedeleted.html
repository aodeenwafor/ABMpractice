            <p>Those aching muscles, the knee, the waist, oh I haven’t had a bowl movement in days, what was I saying again? I can’t remember”. These are some of the things we may experience as we age. The good news is we can control how we age (to some extent); it all needs a little effort. Genetics also plays a role in the outcome of your health as you age. Medical history and how one lived in their younger years may affect the quality of our life when much older.</p>

	        <dt style="color:brown;font-size: 20px"> Physical Activity</dt>
	        <dd>According to Canada physical activity guidelines, it is beneficial to add muscle and bone strengthening activities using major muscle groups at least twice a week. It is important to do more to meet <a href="https://csepguidelines.ca/guidelines/adults-65//">Physical activity guidelines.</a>This will help your posture and balance.

	    </div>
           <dt style="color:brown;font-size: 20px">Maintaining Your Weight</dt>
	        <dd>As you age having a healthy weight is very important. This can be achieved by making good food choices like cutting down on saturated fats in dairy foods and meats and eating slightly more vegetables and whole-grain.</dd>
	       
	        <dt style="color:brown;font-size: 20px">Vitamins are very important</dt>
            <dd>Fruit and vegetables contain lots of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Choose dark green or brightly coloured vegetables and fruit more often. Grab an apple for an afternoon snack instead of cupcake. Spice up your meals with these beautiful foods like adding berries or sliced bananas in your cereal, have vegetables with dinner.</dd>

	    </div>
	        <dt style="color:brown;font-size: 20px">Protein Needs</dt>
	        <dd>Adequate daily protein is needed to replace losses, but too much protein can be hard on the ailing kidneys of older adults (p.635).You don’t always need meat, fish or poultry to meet your protein needs. Use beans, peas or lentils or tofu in salads, soups or pasta sauce.</dd>
	        <p><b> Below is a list of excellent sources of protein, iron and B vitamins. This is just a few, there are much more depending on locality.</b> A more detailed list can be found in <a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/">Canada Food Guide.</a> </p>
				<ul>
				  <li> Meat </li>
				  <li> poultry </li>
				  <li> fish </li>
				<li> legumes such as beans, peas and lentils </li>
				  <li> nuts and seeds </li>
				</ul>
